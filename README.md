() [![Vibe Coded](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vibe-Coded-purple.svg)]()

A high-performance, embedded, GraphQL-native database engine written in C# for .NET 9+. Define your database schema in GraphQL SDL, load data from JSON files, and query with native GraphQL - all without writing any C# table definition code.

> ** Prototype Status**: This is an experimental database engine. While it has comprehensive features and passes all tests, it's not yet ready for production use. Use for research, prototyping, and educational purposes.

##  Quick Start

```graphql
# schema.graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User
}
```

```csharp
using SharpGraph.Core;
using SharpGraph.Core.GraphQL;

var dbPath = "my_database";
var executor = new GraphQLExecutor(dbPath);
var loader = new SchemaLoader(dbPath, executor);

// Load schema and data
loader.LoadSchemaFromFile("schema.graphql");
loader.LoadData(File.ReadAllText("data.json"));

// Query with relationships
var result = executor.Execute(@"{
  users {
    name
    posts { title }
  }
}");
```

## Prisma-Style Filtering & Sorting

SharpGraph supports Prisma-style filtering and sorting through Connection types. This provides an intuitive, GraphQL-native way to query and sort data.

### Filtering with `where`

Filter records using field-level conditions:

```graphql
query SearchCharacters {
  characters {
    items(where: {name: {contains: "Luke"}}) {
      id
      name
      characterType
    }
  }
}
```

**Available filter operators:**
- `equals`: Exact match
- `contains`: String contains (case-insensitive)
- `startsWith`: String starts with
- `endsWith`: String ends with
- `gt`: Greater than (for numbers)
- `lt`: Less than (for numbers)
- `gte`: Greater than or equal
- `lte`: Less than or equal

**Combined filters with AND/OR/NOT:**

```graphql
query FindHumans {
  characters {
    items(where: {
      AND: [
        {characterType: {equals: "Human"}}
        {name: {contains: "Solo"}}
      ]
    }) {
      id
      name
      characterType
    }
  }
}
```

### Sorting with `orderBy` (Prisma-style)

Sort by one or multiple fields using Prisma's intuitive syntax:

```graphql
query SortedCharacters {
  characters {
    items(orderBy: [{name: asc}]) {
      id
      name
      characterType
    }
  }
}
```

**Multiple sort fields (applied in order):**

```graphql
query MultiSortCharacters {
  characters {
    items(orderBy: [{characterType: asc}, {name: asc}]) {
      id
      name
      characterType
      height
    }
  }
}
```

### Pagination with `skip` and `take`

Paginate through results:

```graphql
query PaginatedCharacters {
  characters {
    items(skip: 0, take: 10) {
      id
      name
      characterType
    }
  }
}
```

### Combined: Filter, Sort, and Paginate

```graphql
query AdvancedQuery {
  characters {
    items(
      where: {characterType: {equals: "Human"}}
      orderBy: [{name: asc}]
      skip: 0
      take: 5
    ) {
      id
      name
      characterType
      height
      mass
    }
  }
}
```

## Auto-Generated CRUD Mutations

SharpGraph automatically generates Create, Update, and Delete mutations for every entity in your schema. No configuration needed!

### Create Mutation

```graphql
mutation CreateCharacter {
  createCharacter(input: {
    name: "Luke Skywalker"
    characterType: "Human"
    appearsIn: ["NEWHOPE", "EMPIRE", "JEDI"]
    height: 172.72
    mass: 77.0
    hairColor: "Blond"
    skinColor: "Fair"
    eyeColor: "Blue"
    birthYear: "19BBY"
    homePlanetId: "tatooine"
  }) {
    id
    name
    characterType
  }
}
```

### Update Mutation

```graphql
mutation UpdateCharacter {
  updateCharacter(
    id: "luke"
    input: {
      name: "Luke Skywalker (Updated)"
      height: 173.0
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    height
  }
}
```

### Delete Mutation

```graphql
mutation DeleteCharacter {
  deleteCharacter(id: "luke")
}
```

### Bulk Operations Example

```graphql
mutation CreateMultiple {
  c1: createCharacter(input: {
    name: "Character 1"
    characterType: "Human"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
  
  c2: createCharacter(input: {
    name: "Character 2"
    characterType: "Droid"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Complete CRUD Example

```graphql
# Create
mutation {
  createFilm(input: {
    title: "A New Hope"
    episodeId: 4
    openingCrawl: "It is a period of civil war..."
    director: "George Lucas"
    producer: "Gary Kurtz"
    releaseDate: "1977-05-25"
  }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

# Read with Filtering
query {
  films {
    items(where: {title: {contains: "Hope"}}) {
      id
      title
      episodeId
    }
  }
}

# Update
mutation {
  updateFilm(id: "1", input: {
    title: "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"
  }) {
    id
    title
  }
}

# Delete
mutation {
  deleteFilm(id: "1")
}
```

##  Architecture Overview

SharpGraph is built as a layered architecture:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "GraphQL Layer"
        A[Lexer] --> B[Parser]
        B --> C[Executor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Schema Layer"
        D[Schema Parser] --> E[Schema Loader]
    end
    
    subgraph "Indexing Layer"
        F[Hash Index] --> G[B-Tree Index]
        G --> H[Index Manager]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        I[Table] --> J[MemTable]
        J --> K[Page Cache]
        K --> L[FileManager]
    end
    
    C --> E
    E --> H
    H --> I
```

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

##  Performance

| Benchmark | Average Time | Throughput |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Single record lookup (Hash Index) | 0.40ms | 2,500 ops/sec |
| Range queries (B-Tree) | 0.15ms | 6,667 ops/sec |
| Relationship queries | 1.86ms | 537 ops/sec |
| Full table scans | 0.74ms | 1,351 ops/sec |

*Test environment: Windows 11, .NET 9.0, Star Wars dataset (8 characters, 3 films, 4 planets)*
